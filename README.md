# OOPMProject
This is a java project build to solve the problem of attendance marking in case auditorium sessions. 

We have divided the app into two major parts: 1)Admin Panel 2)Student panel.

The admin panel is the part where all the attendance information from the database (Postgresql) can be altered/modified/viewed.

The student panel is the part where the program updates the attendance of students who scan their ID cards using a barcode scanner.
